## 🧠 1️⃣ Project Name & Problem Statement

**Project Name:** SymptomTracker – AI assisted Symptom & Risk Tracker  

**Problem Statement:**  
People often **track vitals and symptoms** in scattered ways (notes, apps, memory). They lack a simple, interpretable tool to **connect symptoms with possible risks**. Most health apps are black boxes, and many are not transparent about how results are calculated. This project aims to create a **rule-driven + explainable demo app** to visualize health risks clearly.

## 💡 2️⃣ Our Solution

**SymptomTracker** transforms symptom + vital inputs into **explainable risk flags**.  

✅ Features include:  
- 📋 **Input Form** – Log vitals, symptoms, and notes  
- 🧮 **Risk Dashboard** – Flags for **Diabetes, Hypertension, Depression/Mood, Migraine, Sleep Apnea, and Anemia**  
- 📊 **Trend Visualizations** – Graph your risks over time  
- 💾 **Data Export** – Download all entries as CSV for clinician review  
- 🔍 **Explainability** – Rules are transparent and human-readable  
- ⚠️ **Disclaimer** – Educational demo only, **not medical advice**
